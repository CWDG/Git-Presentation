## SSH Keys

Although this is not strictly necessary you'll want to do this because:

*   It is more secure
*   It's easy to use once set up.

## Good Commit Messages

    Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
    characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
    line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
    the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
    two together.

    Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
    bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
    commands like git merge and git revert.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    - Bullet points are okay, too

    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
      single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

    - Use a hanging indent
