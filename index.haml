              * Simple interpretation: There are many clients that access a
                single server.  This server is accessed because it has content
                the clients want.
              * The server can do something or has some resource the client
                wants.

              * HTTP defines nine methods (sometimes referred to as "verbs")
                indicating the desired action to be performed on the
                identified resource. 
              * The available verbs are: HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE,
                CONNECT, PATCH, OPTIONS

              An HTTP Response has a code associated with it.  You probably are familar with some already.

              * 1xx: Informational
              * 2xx: Success
              * 3xx: Redirect
              * 4xx: Client error
              * 5xx: Server error
